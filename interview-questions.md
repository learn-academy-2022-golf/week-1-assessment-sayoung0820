# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is a statement that gives step by step instructions to produce the desired outcome.

Researched answer:

Conditional statements can change depending on the conditions given. They control the output in javascript and determine whether the code will work or not.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: A git is used to collaborate on projects with other coders. Github is there the main project is stored.

Researched answer: A git is a system that allows collobarators to simultaneously work on projects at the same time. Each coder can add changes then push them up to Github. Github is a cloud based service that hosts the main projects in repositories, allowing the project to be better managed by all colaborators.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The loose equality operator and the strict equality operator

Researched answer: Boolean values are returned when using the strict or loose equality operators. The loose equality operator converts the data type to make the equal first, then makes a comparison. The strict equality operator requires that the types of data be the same before returning a boolean.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is a placeholder for a character in a string

Researched answer: The index is the numbered position of a character in a string or other data type. It is either a number or a field containing a number. Javascript indexes are zero based, with strings being zero indexed, which means the counting starts at zero.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays store ordered lists of data types. Strings Strings hold characters

Researched answer: Arrays and strings both store collections of data types. Both also have a length property and are zero indexed. Where they differ is in the data types that they can store. Arrays store same data types, while strings stores characters only. Arrays have a fixed size, strings can be modified.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair progamming requires a navigator and a driver. The navigator instructs the driver, walking through each step one at a time, reading out the instructions clearly and guiding the driver completely

Researched answer: Proper pair programming is essential to being a successful coder and teammate. Each partner takes turns at being the driver and navigator. The driver keeps their hands on the keyboard, inputting data given through instructions from the navigator. This allows each partner to get a better understanding of programming by perfoming each role at different intervals during the pairing. By using two sets of eyes, you are less likely to miss mistakes in the code and more likely to have more energy for problem solving.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: a function that takes other functions as arguments and return other functions or values

2. Jest: javascript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of codebase

3. Objects: unordered data type that has collections of key pairs

4. Method: when a function belongs to an object

5. Classes: blueprint or templates for objects
